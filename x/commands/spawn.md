# /spawn <crew-member> <project>

Explicitly spawn a specific crew member to work on a project. Bypasses the
Orchestrator's routing — use when you know exactly which agent you need.

## Arguments

- `crew-member` — the crew member to spawn (case-insensitive). Accepts both
  character names and role names:
  - `builder`
  - `reviewer`
  - `deployer`
  - `orchestrator`
  - `sysadmin`
  - `architect`
  - `planner`
  - `qa`
  - `security`
  - `monitor`
  - `scout`
  - `proposal-writer`
  - `analyst`

- `project` — the repo name (e.g., `project-alpha`, `bridge`)

## What to Do

### Step 1: Validate the Arguments

Parse the command arguments. If the crew member name is not recognized, list
available crew members. If the project does not exist, report the error.

Verify the repo exists:

```bash
source ./lib/git-api.sh
sm_get "/repos/${SEAMONSTER_ORG}/${PROJECT}" > /dev/null
```

### Step 2: Map to Agent

Map the crew member argument to the correct agent name:

| Input | Agent |
|---|---|
| `builder` | Builder |
| `reviewer` | Reviewer |
| `deployer` | Deployer |

### Step 3: Spawn the Agent

Use the Agent tool to spawn the selected crew member as a subagent. Provide
the project context:

```
Spawning Builder for project: {project}

The agent will work in the context of the {project} repository. It will:
1. Check for open issues labeled build-ready
2. Pick the highest priority unblocked issue
3. Follow the standard issue → branch → build → PR flow
```

If no specific issue is mentioned, the spawned agent should check for open
issues in the project that match its role:
- Builder: issues with `build-ready` or `team/build` labels
- Reviewer: open PRs awaiting review
- Deployer: issues with `deploy-ready` label

### Step 4: Confirm

After spawning, report what was dispatched:

```
Spawned Builder for project-alpha.
Working on: issue #47 — Build authentication module
Branch: issue-47-auth-module
```

## Examples

```
/spawn builder project-alpha
→ Spawns Builder to work on project-alpha's highest priority build task

/spawn reviewer project-alpha
→ Spawns Reviewer to review open PRs in project-alpha

/spawn deployer project-alpha
→ Spawns Deployer to deploy pending deploy-ready issues in project-alpha
```

## Notes

- This command bypasses the Orchestrator's routing. Use it when you know
  exactly which agent and project you want.
- The spawned agent inherits the project's CLAUDE.md conventions.
- If the project has no matching work (e.g., no build-ready issues for
  Builder), the agent reports this and exits.
- Only core crew members (Builder, Reviewer, Deployer) are available
  as interactive subagents. Other crew members are dispatched via git
  issues for autonomous execution.
